<h1>Yesterday</h1>
  <h2>By The Beatles</h2>
  
  <p>Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away.<br>
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say.<br>

I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Why she had to go?<br>

    I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said something wrong.
Now I long for yesterday.
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away.
 Oh, I believe in yesterday.<br>
